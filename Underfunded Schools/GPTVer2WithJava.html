                In the United States, there are many schools that are underfunded, which prevents kids from having a strong foundation for higher education. Public school funding in the United States comes from federal, state, and local sources, but because nearly half of those funds come from local property taxes, the system generates large funding differences between wealthy and impoverished communities.

                1. How you can help: You can donate to help the schools that are underfunded to create better education programs and more classroom supplies so each student will have a comfortable and safe learning experience.

                2. How we will put your money to use: We will do our research on schools that are not being treated fairly because of their location and send the money you donate to their school board so they can upgrade their programs.
